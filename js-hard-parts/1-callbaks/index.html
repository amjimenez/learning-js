      Challenge 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Create a function addTwo that accepts one input and adds 2 to it.
    </p>
    <h2> Challenge 2</h2>
    Create a function addS that accepts one input and adds an "s" to it.
    <h2> Challenge 3</h2>
    Create a function called map that takes two inputs:âˆ‘
    <ol>
      <li>an array of numbers (a list of numbers)</li>
      <li>a 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element of the array (inside of the function 'map')
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Have map return a new array filled with numbers that are the result of using the 'callback' function on each
      element
      of the input array.
    </p>

    map([1,2,3,4,5], multiplyByTwo); //-> [2,4,6,8,10] <br>
    multiplyByTwo(1); //-> 2<br>
    multiplyByTwo(2); //-> 4<br>

    <h2> Challenge 4</h2>
    <p>
      The function forEach takes an array and a callback, and runs the callback on each element of the array. forEach
      does
      not return anything.
    </p>
    <code>
    let alphabet = ''; <br>
    const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']; <br>
    forEach(letters, function(char) { <br>
    alphabet += char; <br>
    }); <br>

    console.log(alphabet); //prints 'abcd' <br>
  </code>

    <b>Extension 1</b>
    <p>
      In the first part of the extension, you're going to rebuild map as mapWith. This time you're going to use forEach
      inside of mapWith instead of using a for loop.
    </p>
    <b>
      Extension 2
    </b>
    <p>
      The function reduce takes an array and reduces the elements to a single value. For example it can sum all the
      numbers,
      multiply them, or any operation that you can put into a function.
    </p>
    <code>
  const nums = [4, 1, 3]; <br/>
  const add = function(a, b) { return a + b; } <br/>
  reduce(nums, add, 0); //-> 8 <br/>
  </code>
    <p>
      Here's how it works. The function has an "accumulator value" which starts as the initialValue and accumulates the
      output of each loop. The array is iterated over, passing the accumulator and the next array element as arguments
      to
      the callback. The callback's return value becomes the new accumulator value. The next loop executes with this new
      accumulator value. In the example above, the accumulator begins at 0. add(0,4) is called. The accumulator's value
      is
      now 4. Then add(4, 1) to make it 5. Finally add(5, 3) brings it to 8, which is returned.
    </p>
    <b>Extension 3</b>
    <p>
      Construct a function intersection that compares input arrays and returns a new array with elements found in all of
      the
      inputs. BONUS: Use reduce!
    </p>
    <b>Extension 4</b>
    <p>
      Construct a function union that compares input arrays and returns a new array that contains all elements. If there
      are
      duplicate elements, only add it once to the new array. Preserve the order of the elements starting from the first
      element of the first input array. BONUS: Use reduce!
    </p>
    <b>Extension 5</b>
    <p>
      Construct a function objOfMatches that accepts two arrays and a callback. objOfMatches will build an object and
      return
      it. To build the object, objOfMatches will test each element of the first array using the callback to see if the
      output matches the corresponding element (by index) of the second array. If there is a match, the element from the
      first array becomes a key in an object, and the element from the second array becomes the corresponding value.
    </p>
    <b>Extension 6</b>
    <p>
      Construct a function multiMap that will accept two arrays: an array of values and an array of callbacks. multiMap
      will
      return an object whose keys match the elements in the array of values. The corresponding values that are assigned
      to
      the keys will be arrays consisting of outputs from the array of callbacks, where the input to each callback is the
      key.
    </p>
    <b>Extension 7</b>
    <p>
      Construct a function objectFilter that accepts an object as the first parameter and a callback function as the
      second
      parameter. objectFilter will return a new object. The new object will contain only the properties from the input
      object such that the property's value is equal to the property's key passed into the callback.

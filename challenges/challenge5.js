/****************************************
 * CODING CHALLENGE 5
 */

/**
 * Remember the tip calculator challenge? Lets create a more advance version
 * using everything we learned!
 * This time, John and his family wen to 5 different restaurants. The bill were
 * $124, $48, $268, $180, and $42.
 * John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15%
 *  when the bill is between $50 and less than $200, and 10% if the bill is more
 * than 200.
 *
 * Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
 * 1. Create an object with an array for the bill values
 * 2. Add a method to calculate the tip
 * 3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and
 * do the tip calculations
 * 4. As an output, create
 *  1) a new array containing all tips, and
 *  2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip).
 * HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in
 * the loop.
 */
/*
 * EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4
 * different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
 * Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10%
 *  when the bill is between $100 and less than $300, and 25% if the bill is more
 * than $300.
 *
 * 5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping
 * rules
 * 6. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a  given
 * array of tips.
 * HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a
 * variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by
 * the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average)
 *
 * 7. Calculate the average tip for each family
 * 8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average.
 *
 * GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜„

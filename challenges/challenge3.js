 * CODING CHALLENGE 3

/**
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The 
bills were $124, $48 and $268

To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a 
function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50,
15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than 
$200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays: 
1: containing all three tips (one for each bill).
2: Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(Note: To calculate %20 of a value, simply multiply if with (20/100) = 0.2)

Good luck. ğŸ˜„
